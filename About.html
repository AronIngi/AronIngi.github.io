					<h2 id="productionHeader">How We Produce</h2>
					<p id="productionText">We wanted to start this project because there is a lack of natural materials used in clothes.
					we started this brand on May 20, 2019 and we have tried to expand it since then. TC clothing stands for thicc clothing but here we only sell high quality t-shirts and hoodies in all kinds of sizes and colors.
					we only want the best for our customers. for our hoodies and t-shirts, we use high-quality cotton grown in America on specially selected fields where our professional handpick the cotton. the cotton is then delivered to our factory where it is dried in our high quality electric furnaces. Then the cotton is separated from the seeds and cleaned. After that the cotton is made in to a thread, the thread is then put into a machine where it’s made into cotton fabric and is ready to work with. Professionals then take over and sew the hoodies and t-shirt together. When a customer orders a product, it’s shipped on an airplane and takes about a week to arrive at the retail outlet, but we also want to ensure that the product is delivered in an acceptable manner and will be in perfect condition for the customer. If these conditions are not fulfilled we offer a refund but hopefully you never have to use it in our service here at TC clothing.
					We also give 15% of the total income to mental health
					, which helps with mental illness.
					and remember: <b>quality over quantity</b></p>
